Firestarter is a way to quicky create your MVP web app. You just copy the code, then adapt to your project.

It uses/will use Firebase, NextJS, Tailwind CSS, Tailwind Elements, and Github Actions

## Still In Progress!

I am working on the basic feature right now, so you are really early. Watch this space.

## Demo
You can see the latest deployed demo here:

Eventually you will be able to sign up, log in and do stuff. However beware that the data may be cleared out at any time as this is just a demo.
