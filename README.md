## Firestarter is:

📦 A starter kit for quickly building your next app. Side project or startup!

🎨 That uses Tailwind for clean and easily adapatable design and style.

🔥 That uses Firebase for a Serverless backend. No messing with machines!

🚀 That uses NextJS, for convenient packaging and deployment of code and pages.

⚛️ Uses ReactJS for responsive UI.

🆓 Free to use! MIT Licensed.

### How it works:

1. Create your own [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) account and project.
2. Sign up for free hosting at [Vercel](https://vercel.com/dashboard).
3. Fork this repo, and clone to your machine.
4. Set up the environment variables based on your Firebase account.
5. Link your forked repo to Vercel.
6. Well done you now have your app running in production!
7. Buy a custom domain name and link to your Vercel account, if you want to.
8. Customize by adding your own code and features, and/or removing any features you don't want from our examples.
